CourseResources.zip contains three Unity packages:
- SoundToolKit_Lite_v1.6 contains the STK Lite plugin. This package can be imported to any existing or new project.

- CourseSceneClear contains the scene that is presented in the course videos in a raw version - it has no SoundToolKit integration. 
You can use this scene as a training basis to integrate it with STK yourself while progressing with the course.

- CourseScenePrepared contains the same scene as in CourseSceneClear package, except this one is already fully integrated with SoundToolKit. The package contais SoundToolKit Lite as well. 
The scene can serve as a demo and a reference - you can compare the effects of your own integration with it, see how some of the things were done and how the sound differs between versions.

Enjoy!
